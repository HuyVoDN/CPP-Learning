# C++learning
My own C++ Learning from a book.
This is my knowledge of everything I'll be learning through reading a Book named Starting Out With C++ from Control Structures To Object by Tony Gaddis
Everything will be commented out since it isn't written under C++, well technically it is but the machine doesn't understand jackshit lol.
